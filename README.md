The primary focus has been on implementing dynamic memory allocation and creating a robust data structure. The culmination of these efforts has resulted in two distinct programs, each addressing a specific aspect of the project â€“ one with dynamic memory allocation and the other utilizing binary file handling.
The dynamic memory allocation program is a key component of this project. It enables efficient memory management, allowing for the creation and manipulation of a comprehensive data structure.

Features:
Dynamic Memory Management: The program employs dynamic memory allocation to optimize resource utilization and facilitate scalability;
Comprehensive Data Structure: A well-defined data structure forms the backbone of the program, providing a solid foundation for storing and managing information;
Prototypical Database Operations: While this version doesn't feature a complete database, it lays the groundwork for future development by incorporating functionality for reading, writing, and modifying information related to entities.
